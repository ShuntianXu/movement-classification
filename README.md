Movement Classification using ANN
=================================

This is the project for movement classification using neural network. The final product is the Arduino program running on [LilyPad Simblee BLE Board](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13633) that could perform real-time movement classification using acceleration data captured by the IMU, [MPU-9250](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13762).
