Data
====

The [raw data set](https://github.com/walrus/walrus/tree/development/data) used in this project was contributed by Walrus and his friends. The data is the acceleration of movements of three exercises, i.e. press up, sit up, and lunge. The data set also includes the invalid data representing the movements other than the three valid exercises.

The raw data could be preprocessed, i.e. feature selection and normalization, using the Matlab code.
